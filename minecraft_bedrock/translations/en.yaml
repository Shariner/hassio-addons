      than the gamemode value saved by the server during world creation
      even if those values are set in server.properties after world creation.

      force-gamemode=true forces the server to send to the client gamemode values
      other than the gamemode value saved by the server during world creation
      if those values are set in server.properties after world creation.

  enable-lan-visibility:
    name: Enable LAN Visibility
    description: |
      Listen and respond to clients that are looking for servers on the LAN. This will cause the server
      to bind to the default ports (19132, 19133) even when `server-port` and `server-portv6`
      have non-default values. Consider turning this off if LAN discovery is not desirable, or when
      running multiple servers on the same host may lead to port conflicts.
      Allowed values: "true" or "false"

  server-authoritative-movement:
    name: Server Authoritative Movement
    description: |
      Changes the server authority on movement:
      "client-auth": Server has no authority and accepts all positions from the client.
      "server-auth": Server takes user input and simulates the Player movement but accepts the Client version if there is disagreement.
      "server-auth-with-rewind": The server will replay local user input and will push it to the Client so it can correct the position if it does not match.
      		The clients will rewind time back to the correction time, apply the correction, then replay all the player's inputs since then. This results in smoother and more frequent corrections.

  player-position-acceptance-threshold:
    name: Player Position Acceptance Threshold
    description: |
      Only used with "server-auth-with-rewind".
      This is the tolerance of discrepancies between the Client and Server Player position. This helps prevent sending corrections too frequently
      for non-cheating players in cases where the server and client have different perceptions about when a motion started. For example damage knockback or being pushed by pistons.
      The higher the number, the more tolerant the server will be before asking for a correction. Values beyond 1.0 have increased chances of allowing cheating.

  player-movement-action-direction-threshold:
    name: Player Movement Action Direction Threshold
    description: |
      The amount that the player's attack direction and look direction can differ.
      Allowed values: Any value in the range of [0, 1] where 1 means that the
      direction of the players view and the direction the player is attacking
      must match exactly and a value of 0 means that the two directions can
      differ by up to and including 90 degrees.

  server-authoritative-block-breaking-pick-range-scalar:
    name: Server Authoritative Block Breaking Pick Range Scalar
    description: If true, the server will compute block mining operations in sync with the client so it can verify that the client should be able to break blocks when it thinks it can.

  chat-restriction:
    name: Chat Restriction
    description: |
      This represents the level of restriction applied to the chat for each player that joins the server.
      "None" is the default and represents regular free chat.
      "Dropped" means the chat messages are dropped and never sent to any client. Players receive a message to let them know the feature is disabled.
      "Disabled" means that unless the player is an operator, the chat UI does not even appear. No information is displayed to the player.

  disable-player-interaction:
    name: Disable Player Interaction
    description: If true, the server will inform clients that they should ignore other players when interacting with the world. This is not server authoritative.

  client-side-chunk-generation-enabled:
    name: Client Side Chunk Generation Enabled
    description: If true, the server will inform clients that they have the ability to generate visual level chunks outside of player interaction distances.

  block-network-ids-are-hashes:
    name: Block Network IDs Are Hashes
    description: If true, the server will send hashed block network ID's instead of id's that start from 0 and go up.  These id's are stable and won't change regardless of other block changes.

  server-build-radius-ratio:
    name: Server Build Radius Ratio
    description: |
      Allowed values: "Disabled" or any value in range [0.0, 1.0]
      If "Disabled" the server will dynamically calculate how much of the player's view it will generate, assigning the rest to the client to build.
      Otherwise from the overridden ratio tell the server how much of the player's view to generate, disregarding client hardware capability.
      Only valid if client-side-chunk-generation-enabled is enabled
